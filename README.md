# Config Files
0 to 100, real quick
---

## Instructions:
1. `cd $HOME/Documents` - Executive decision to have this under Documents
2. `git` - This prompts the install for xcode command line tools 
3. `git clone https://github.com/mkdorff/configFiles.git && cd configFiles && chmod +x setupMac.sh && ./setupMac.sh`

This gets us 80% there. Everything else is manual and as I get better at AppleScript (JS works too now?), more things
will be automated.

## Assumptions:
User name for computer is 'mohonri'
